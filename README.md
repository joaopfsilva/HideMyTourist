# HideMyTourist

HideMyTourist is a webapp that allows someone, that has an account, create a personal 
list of places of his preference for a specific city, and share with their friends.

The concept is applied for those who like to go to a city and not follows the traditional 
touristic guides that we see in the internet but, visit places of his friends' preferences.

>>> Ruby on Rails!!
